# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Currency Converter API project. Security is treated as the highest priority with multiple layers of protection, continuous monitoring, and automated validation.

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Strategy

The project implements security at multiple layers:

1. **Code Level Security**
   - Static analysis with Bandit for Python-specific vulnerabilities
   - Code quality analysis with SonarQube including security hotspots
   - Automated code formatting and linting to prevent common issues

2. **Dependency Security**
   - Continuous vulnerability scanning with Safety
   - OWASP Dependency Check against known vulnerability databases
   - License compliance monitoring for legal requirements

3. **Container Security**
   - Multi-scanner approach with Trivy and Grype
   - Dockerfile best practices enforcement with Hadolint
   - Container image signing with Cosign for supply chain integrity
   - SBOM generation for complete dependency visibility

4. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Kubernetes security policies with OPA Conftest
   - Security context enforcement (non-root, read-only filesystem)
   - Resource limits and network policies
   - Pod Security Standards compliance

5. **Runtime Security**
   - Health checks and liveness probes
   - Structured logging for security monitoring
   - Encrypted communications and secure configuration management

6. **Supply Chain Security**
   - Cryptographic signing of all container images
   - Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for all releases
   - Provenance tracking and attestation

## Security Tools Integration

### Automated Security Scanning

| Tool | Purpose | Frequency | Threshold |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Bandit | Python security linting | Every commit | Zero high-severity issues |
| Safety | Dependency vulnerabilities | Every commit | Zero known vulnerabilities |
| Trivy | Container scanning | Every commit | Zero critical vulnerabilities |
| SonarQube | Code quality & security | Pull requests | Quality gate must pass |
| OWASP Dependency Check | Known vulnerabilities | Weekly + releases | CVSS < 7.0 allowed |
| GitLeaks | Secret detection | Every commit | Zero secrets exposed |
| TruffleHog | Advanced secret scanning | Every commit | Zero verified secrets |
| Grype | Additional vuln scanning | Releases | Zero high-severity |
| Hadolint | Dockerfile best practices | Every commit | Zero errors |
| Kubesec | Kubernetes security | Every commit | Score > 0 |

### Security Configuration Files

- **`.bandit`**: Python security scanner configuration with test exclusions
- **`sonar-project.properties`**: SonarQube analysis settings with security rules
- **`dependency-check-suppressions.xml`**: OWASP vulnerability management
- **`security-policies/dockerfile.rego`**: OPA policies for container security
- **`security-policies/kubernetes.rego`**: OPA policies for K8s deployment security

## Security Quality Gates

### Pull Request Requirements

All pull requests must pass the following security checks:

- Zero high or critical severity vulnerabilities
- No secrets detected in code or commit history
- All security linting checks pass
- Container images vulnerability-free
- Kubernetes security policies satisfied
- Test coverage above 80% threshold

### Release Requirements

Production releases have additional security requirements:

- Pre-release security validation complete
- Container images cryptographically signed
- SBOM generated and attached
- All security scans completed successfully
- Staging deployment health checks passed

## Vulnerability Management

### Severity Classification

- **Critical**: Immediate blocking, emergency patch required
- **High**: 24-hour resolution, scheduled deployment
- **Medium**: Next maintenance window, tracked resolution
- **Low**: Planned resolution, documented risk acceptance

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection**: Automated scanning identifies vulnerability
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluates impact and exploitability
3. **Response**: Appropriate action based on severity classification
4. **Tracking**: All vulnerabilities tracked until resolution
5. **Verification**: Resolution validated through re-scanning

## Container Security Hardening

### Image Security

- **Base Images**: Distroless images for minimal attack surface
- **User Context**: Non-root execution (UID 1000)
- **Filesystem**: Read-only root filesystem with temporary volumes
- **Capabilities**: All Linux capabilities dropped
- **Networking**: No host networking or privileged access

### Runtime Security

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

## Incident Response

### Security Monitoring

- Real-time vulnerability alerts via GitHub Security tab
- Weekly comprehensive security assessments
- Automated notifications for new CVEs affecting dependencies
- Security metrics dashboard with KPIs

### Emergency Response

1. **Critical Vulnerability Detected**
   - Immediate deployment blocking activated
   - Security team notified within 15 minutes
   - Emergency patch process initiated

2. **Secret Exposure**
   - Immediate secret rotation
   - Access logs reviewed
   - Impact assessment completed

3. **Container Compromise**
   - Affected containers immediately terminated
   - Incident response team activated
   - Forensic analysis initiated

## Compliance & Governance

### Security Standards

- **OWASP Top 10**: All risks assessed and mitigated
- **CIS Benchmarks**: Container and Kubernetes hardening applied
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Security controls implemented
- **SLSA Level 2**: Supply chain security requirements met

### Audit Requirements

- All security scans results archived for 2 years
- Container image provenance maintained
- Security policy violations logged and tracked
- Regular security assessments documented

## Local Development Security

### Security Development Workflow

```bash
# Initial setup
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Pre-commit security checks
bandit -r app/ -ll -f json
safety check --json
trivy fs . --severity HIGH,CRITICAL

# Container security validation
hadolint Dockerfile
trivy image currency-converter:latest

# Kubernetes security assessment
kubesec scan helm/currency-converter/templates/deployment.yaml
```

### Security Testing

```bash
# Run security test suite
pytest tests/security/ -v

# Validate security policies
conftest verify --policy security-policies/ helm/currency-converter/templates/

# Check for secrets
gitleaks detect --source . --verbose
```
